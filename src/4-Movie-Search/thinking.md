Okay, the user wants to build a Movie Search App using React. They want to start with a mock version, then add functionality, and include all possible features with comments. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to outline what the app does. The main features are searching for movies by title, displaying details like title, poster, release date, and rating, and allowing users to add movies to a favorites list. The learning outcomes involve using third-party APIs, managing state, and implementing search functionality.

Starting with the mock version makes sense. Mocking the data helps in designing the UI without worrying about the API integration. I'll create static components for the search bar, movie list, and movie details. Using dummy data for movies will let the user see the structure.

Next, transitioning to the functional app. The key here is integrating the OMDB API. I'll need to handle the API key, fetch data based on the search query, and manage loading and error states. Using useState and useEffect hooks will be essential for handling state changes and side effects.

Including all features: search, display movie details, favorites list. For the favorites, I'll need another state array to track which movies are favorited. Toggling favorites and persisting them to localStorage will add complexity but are necessary for a complete app.

Adding comments is crucial for the user's understanding. Each component and function should have clear comments explaining their purpose. Also, error handling for API calls and form validation for the search input are important to mention.

Finally, suggesting advanced features like pagination, debouncing the search input, and using a UI library can help the user expand the app further. I'll make sure the code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices for React development.

I need to ensure that each part of the code is explained, especially how state is managed between components, how props are passed, and how effects are used for API calls and localStorage. Testing each feature step-by-step will help catch any issues early on.
